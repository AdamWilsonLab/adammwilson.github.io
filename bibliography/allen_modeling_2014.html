  <p>Understanding the drivers of phenological events is vital for forecasting species responses to climate change. We have developed flexible Bayesian survival regression models to assess a 29-year, individual-level time series of flowering phenology from four species of Japanese cherry trees (Prunus spachiana, Prunus x yedoensis, Prunus jamasakura, and Prunus lannesiana), from the Tama Forest Cherry Preservation Garden in Hachioji, Japan. Our modeling framework used time-varying (chill and heat units) and time-invariant (slope, aspect, and elevation) factors and demonstrated some important features for modeling phenology of temperate plants. Our results show that both chill and heat contribute to flowering times and that microsite factors likely modulate the temperatures experienced by each tree. Sequential effects of chilling and heating, as opposed to parallel chilling and heating, were best supported by the data and correspond well to our physiological understanding of plant flowering physiology and phenology. We found limited species differences in sensitivity to chill, but that earlier flowering taxa, such as P. spachiana, were more sensitive to heat than later flowering taxa, such as P. lannesiana. Under climate change projections from an ensemble of three Regional Climate Models, we expect flowering to shift 30-31 days earlier on average for all four taxa by 2100 under the A1B emissions scenario. Dramatic shifts in the flowering times of cherry trees may have implications for economically important cultural festivals in Japan and East Asia.</p>
