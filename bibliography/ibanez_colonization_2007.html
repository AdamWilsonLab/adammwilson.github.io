  <h1>Colonization versus invasion: do the same traits matter?</h1>
  <h2>Ibanez, Ines and Silander, John. A and Wilson, Adam M. and LaFleur, N.</h2>
  <p>There is much we can learn from the invasion process to help us determine which native species will be successful expanding their ranges under global change. In addition, controlling and preventing the spread of invasive species are common goals among ecologists and natural resources managers. However, reliable forecasts of the spread of newly introduced species are rare. The idiosyncratic nature of the invasion process, where both historical and local conditions affect the likelihood of establishment, makes generalization of the invasion process very difficult and hampers our ability to generate guidelines for the early control of potentially invasive species and their newly arrived populations. To develop reliable models of future plant invasions in New England we studied the past patterns of plant spread into the region. Information on invasive plant species presence, abundance, and site properties were gathered for more than 4200 locations in New England by volunteers working in conjunction with the Invasive Plant Atlas of New England (IPANE). This data set was combined with climate, land-use and other environmental variables to construct a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) model describing the invasion process. This approach was appropriate in that it provides for the specification of uncertainty in model components and accepts prior knowledge and data from multiple sources. In addition, HB modeling allowed us to incorporate data collected at different spatial and temporal scales, and more importantly, to deal with the fact that the spread of recently introduced species is an ongoing process.</p>
