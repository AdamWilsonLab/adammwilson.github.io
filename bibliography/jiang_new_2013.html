  <h1>A New Class of Flexible Link Function with Application to Spatially Correlated Species Co-occurrence in Cape Floristic Region</h1>

  <p>Understanding the mechanisms that allow biological species to co-occur is of great interest to ecologists. Here we investigate the factors that infuence co-occurrence of members of the genus Protea in the Cape Floristic Region of southwestern Africa, a global hotspot of biodiversity. Due to the binomial nature of our response, a critical issue is to choose appropriate link functions for the regression model. In this paper we propose a new family of fexible link functions for modeling binomial response data. By introducing a power parameter into the cdf corresponding to a symmetric link function and its mirror refection, greater fexibility in skewness can be achieved in both positive and negative directions. Through simulated data sets and analysis of the Protea co-occurrence data, we show that the proposed link function is quite fexible and performs better against link misspeciâ¬šcation than existing standard link functions.</p>
