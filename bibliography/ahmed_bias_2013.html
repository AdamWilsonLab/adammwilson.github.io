  <h1>Bias correction and downscaling of climate model outputs for climate change impact assessments in the U.S. Northeast</h1>
  <h2>Ahmed, KF and Wang, GL and Silander, John. A and Wilson, Adam M. and Allen, Jenica M</h2>
  <p>Statistical downscaling can be used to efficiently downscale a large number of General Circulation Model
(GCM) outputs to a fine temporal and spatial scale. To facilitate regional impact assessments, this study
statistically downscales (to 1∕8° spatial resolution) and corrects the bias of daily maximum and minimum
temperature and daily precipitation data from six GCMs and four Regional Climate Models (RCMs) for the
northeast United States (US) using the Statistical Downscaling and Bias Correction (SDBC) approach. Based
on these downscaled data from multiple models, five extreme indices were analyzed for the future climate
to quantify future changes of climate extremes. For a subset of models and indices, results based on raw
and bias corrected model outputs for the present-day climate were compared with observations, which dem-
onstrated that bias correction is important not only for GCM outputs, but also for RCM outputs. For future cli-
mate, bias correction led to a higher level of agreements among the models in predicting the magnitude and
capturing the spatial pattern of the extreme climate indices. We found that the incorporation of dynamical
downscaling as an intermediate step does not lead to considerable differences in the results of statistical downscaling for the study domain.</p>
