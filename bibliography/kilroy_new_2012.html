  <h1>A new method of estimating fynbos plant community composition via remote sensing</h1>
  <h2>Kilroy, Hayley A. and Wilson, Adam M. and Merow, Cory and Silander, John. A</h2>
  <p>Standard remote sensing classification techniques have been used in South Africa to discriminate fynbos from other vegetation types, and have been used to track fire regimes, estimate biomass, or monitor the spread of invasive species over time in fynbos systems. Mixed-pixel or “fuzzy” classification techniques are often used, which provides more continuous classification categories and better accuracy. However, there is potential to use subpixel classification techniques to quantify even finer categories, such as the percent cover of specific families, genera, or functional groups of plants. Two maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models were constructed as a feasibility test for fynbos community composition classification. One model incorporated field measurements of individual leaves’ spectral reflectance, the other model incorporated spectral signatures derived from ERDAS IMAGINE’s Subpixel Classification tool using relevé plot data. The accuracy of the models’ predictions of relative plant family abundances  varied by model and by family. This new technique has the potential to remotely determine relative community composition over large areas, as well as to monitor vegetation changes over space and time.</p>
