  <p>In producing high resolution climate datasets for climate change and species distribution modeling, researchers are often faced with the challenge of selecting a method that performs well for interpolating values across complex spatially varying landscapes with heterogeneous sampling densities, over multiple seasons and years. In this research, we compare predictions of daily maximum temperature at a resolution of 1 km for Oregon in 2010, using five interpolation methods: Kriging, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Climatologically Aided Interpolation (CAI) and Fusion of Satellites Stations (FSS). We assessed accuracy using a number of metrics including Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), as well as multisampling, variations in hold out proportions, and map visualization. We found that multi-time scale methods (CAI and FSS) performed better on average with lower MAE and RMSE than single-time scale methods (Kriging, GWR GAM). Results also indicate that CAI with Kriging produces smoother surfaces without many of the physiographic features found in the landscape when compared to FSS with Kriging. The research suggests that a denser meteorological station network and additional procedures of assessment may be necessary to differentiate among the CAI and FSS methods.</p>
