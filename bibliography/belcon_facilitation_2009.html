  <h1>Facilitation of global change research in the tropics: science and data management</h1>

  <p>To  date,  much  global  change  research  has  focused  on  temperate  and  polar  systems (Parmesan, 2006). However, it is becoming increasingly clear that even small changes in temperature and precipitation can have large consequences for organisms in the tropics (e.g. Clark, 2007). Since the mid-1970s, tropical regions have experienced a mean temperature
increase  of  0.26°C±0.05°C  per  decade  (Malhi  & Wright,  2004).  Global climate  models predict overall increases in tropical temperatures of 1–4°C in the 21st  century and regional changes in precipitation with local increases of up to 8% and local decreases of up to 35% (IPCC, 2007). While it is widely acknowledged that these shifts in climatic conditions will likely  have  significant  effects  on  the  flora  and  fauna  of  the  tropics,  there  is  currently insufficient data to predict and mitigate these impacts. In addition to climate change, tropical ecosystems  also  face  a  host  of  threats  including  deforestation,  pollutants,  habitat  loss, overexploitation,  degradation  and  fragmentation  (Wright,  2005).  Given  that  tropical ecosystems provide a wealth of ecosystem services and harbor a large proportion of the earth’s biodiversity, urgent action is needed to increase understanding of how these valuable and complex systems will respond to ongoing and predicted threats. Studies of global change in the tropics have been hindered by several challenges unique to tropical systems. First, the high species richness of most biological communities in the tropics makes it difficult to carry out inventories and to characterize interactions. As a result, we lack basic data for most tropical species, including species’ resource requirements,
environmental tolerances and distribution patterns. Thus, it is not surprising that we lack sufficient information to make informed predictions of how tropical species and communities will respond to changes in climatic conditions or the degree to which they can recover from other types of human  disturbance. Second, most countries in the tropics are developing
nations and lack the infrastructure and funding for large scale global change research. As a result, there is currently a paucity of long term climate and biological records for most tropical sites, making it difficult to ascertain whether communities are changing and whether such changes are due to changing environmental conditions.</p>
