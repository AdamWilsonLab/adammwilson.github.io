  <h1>Photographs published in the 2010 University of Connecticut President’s Report entitled "What’s your Spark?", which included a story about Adam Wilson’s research</h1>
  <h2>Wilson, Adam M.</h2>
  <p>Wilson’s work, though centered in the realm of ecology and evolutionary biology, reaches across numerous disciplines, involving statistics, climatology, and remote sensing. He also collaborates with experts at universities and quasi-governmental organizations in South Africa and the United States.
“In the field of ecology, there are so many large, complex problems that are going to require a multidisciplinary approach,” Wilson says. “Climate change is an example – probably the best example – where no one field can tell the whole story.”
Silander cites Wilson’s aptitude for working across diverse disciplines as one of his strengths. “I view the students that are going to be most productive as those who are stretched across disciplines and can actually talk to a variety of different people,” Silander says. “Oftentimes, some of the most exciting things come from work that is interdisciplinary.”</p>
