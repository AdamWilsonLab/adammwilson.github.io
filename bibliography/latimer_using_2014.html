  <h1>Using statistical models to study climate-disturbance-plant interactions</h1>
  <h2>Latimer, Andrew M. and Wilson, Adam M. and Merow, Cory</h2>
  <p>Rising global temperatures and greater human disturbance are increasing disturbance
frequency in many ecosystems, with large effects on biodiversity and ecosystem processes. The plant community – or “vegetation” in aggregate – is affected directly by climate and indirectly by climatic effects on disturbance rates. In turn, the characteristics of the plant community can feed back to affect disturbance rates, especially in the case of wildfire. The goal of this talk is to demonstrate the use of statistical models to study these relationships. To do so, we focus on three related case studies in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa:
1) Using event models to relate probability of fire occurrence to weather. Here we use
nonparametric event models to accommodate left- and right-censoring in the observations of fire return times, and to relate probabilities of burning to weather
conditions. We also incorporate random effects to account for unexplained spatial
variation. Models demonstrate important effects of weather as well as of longer-term
variation in ocean sea surface temperature.
2) Fitting simple functional forms to describe and explain post-fire vegetation regrowth.
We use this approach to pull major informative patterns from a large data set of
MODIS satellite measurements of “greenness” as it increases after wildfire in many
individual patches of South African shrubland. Features of these curves can be
interpreted biologically and can be related to weather and other environmental factors.
Using the results, we can also project vegetation response under future modeled
climates.
3) Extending species distribution models. We discuss using integral projection models to
identify environmental limitations on population growth rates of individual plant
species. The goal of these models is to use relatively sparse demographic information
to parameterize general environment-vital rate relationships which be combined to
provide insight into the factors most limiting the species distribution. We also provide
an update on an R package that implements hierarchical species distribution models
that incorporate spatial random effects and account for land-use transformation and
variable detection rates.

In these examples, we use hierarchical statistical models to integrate moderately large data sets and gain insight into underlying processes, while also characterizing uncertainty associated with the results. We aim to demonstrate the utility of hierarchical statistical models for these purposes, but we also hope to encourage discussion by flagging challenges for ecologists that this workshop might address.</p>
