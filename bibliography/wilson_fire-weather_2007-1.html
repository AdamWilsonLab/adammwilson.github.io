  <h1>The Fire-Weather Relationship in the South African Fynbos: Implications under Climate Change</h1>
  <h2>Wilson, Adam M. and Latimer, A. and Silander, John. A</h2>
  <p>Fire is a defining component of the fynbos ecosystem in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) of South Africa. Many ecologically important species require fire for reproduction and the frequency of fire is a primary determinant of species composition. It has been hypothesized that climate change will increase fire frequency by raising temperature and reducing the reliability of rainfall. However, little work has been done to quantify the relationship between fire occurrence and climate factors. In this study, we present spatio-temporal statistical models to explain the monthly variability of fire frequency in mountain fynbos regions from 1980-2000. Meteorological data are from the Climate Systems Analysis group in Cape Town and the fire data were provided by CapeNature. We found a clear relationship between temperature, precipitation, and fire events, with more and larger fires occurring in hotter, drier months and years. Other important factors include total precipitation over the previous 12 months and the El Nino Southern Oscillation. These findings have important ramifications for conservation and management of fynbos. If climate change leads to higher temperatures or lower rainfall, our models imply that fire frequency will increase. Increased fire frequency will favor re-sprouters and other species that reproduce quickly over plants with slower reproduction cycles. Thus, if the fire regime changes, the community composition of the fynbos could change.</p>
