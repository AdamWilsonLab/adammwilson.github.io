	abstract = {Aim

We provide a step-by-step demonstration of how a map of species' detections at continental extent can be downscaled to a fine-grain map of occurrence probabilities using a two-scale hierarchical Bayesian modelling ({HBM}). The method requires fine-grain environmental data, but it does not require fine-grain data on species detections. We demonstrate how it can incorporate spatial autocorrelation ({SAC}) and informative priors based on known habitat preferences, and how it can provide maps of uncertainty about the downscaled predictions.


Location

{USA}.


Methods

We used range map and point record data on the distribution of American three-toed woodpecker (Picoides dorsalis, Baird 1858) to produce a reliable coarse-grain (160 km × 160 km) map of the species' presences and absences. We developed an {HBM} combining coarse-grain information with fine-grain (20 km × 20 km) environmental data to predict probabilities of occurrence at the fine grain together with 95\% prediction intervals. The model incorporated {SAC} in the form of conditional autoregressive ({CAR}) random effects. It also incorporated prior knowledge on habitat preferences in the form of prior distribution of parameters. We evaluated the predictions using 751 well-surveyed fine-grain cells.


Results

Our {HBM} produced reliable fine-grain probabilities of occurrence that matched the detections and non-detections in the 751 validation cells well (Nagelkerke's R2 = 0.69, {AUC} = 0.93). By mapping the uncertainty in the downscaled predictions, we identified areas of low uncertainty and high occurrence probability, as well as large areas of high prediction uncertainty. Mapping the autocorrelation term enabled to identify areas of likely spurious observations.


Main conclusions

We demonstrate how hierarchical downscaling enables estimation of species distributions at grains finer than the grain of the original data. The approach can integrate various types of information on distribution and biology in a single statistical framework, and it enables propagating and mapping prediction uncertainty. Yet there are also computational challenges for large datasets.},

	abstract = {Conserving biodiversity on our changing planet requires understanding how our climate affects ecosystem resilience. This is especially important in disturbance-prone ecosystems such as the Cape Floristic Region ({CFR}) of South Africa. Fire risk in the {CFR} is sensitive to climatic variability and a warmer and drier future will likely lead to more frequent fires. However, the sensitivity of post-fire recovery and biomass accumulation to climate is not well understood despite its importance in the fire regime. In this study, I apply a novel hierarchical approach to model post-fire biomass recovery using over a decade of satellite-derived vegetation observations ({MODIS} {NDVI}). Recovery rate was positively associated with minimum winter temperature and maximum summer precipitation and negatively associated with precipitation seasonality and maximum summer temperature. By incorporating millions of satellite observations over the last decade, it is now possible to quantify broad scale patterns in ecosystem recovery and identify climatic associations of these ‘recovery gradients’ in post-fire ecosystem dynamics. Despite being ecologically coarse in its reliance on {NDVI}, this modeling framework allows exploration and development of more specific hypotheses that can be tested in the field with detailed on-the-ground surveys to validate and explain ecosystem recovery predictions. Furthermore, this approach could be combined with ongoing floristic inventories to monitor ecosystem resilience and identify areas with anomalous post-fire recovery trajectories in near-real time.},

	abstract = {Rising global temperatures and greater human disturbance are increasing disturbance 
frequency in many ecosystems, with large effects on biodiversity and ecosystem processes. The plant community – or “vegetation” in aggregate – is affected directly by climate and indirectly by climatic effects on disturbance rates. In turn, the characteristics of the plant community can feed back to affect disturbance rates, especially in the case of wildfire. The goal of this talk is to demonstrate the use of statistical models to study these relationships. To do so, we focus on three related case studies in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa: 
1) Using event models to relate probability of fire occurrence to weather. Here we use 
nonparametric event models to accommodate left- and right-censoring in the observations of fire return times, and to relate probabilities of burning to weather 
conditions. We also incorporate random effects to account for unexplained spatial 
variation. Models demonstrate important effects of weather as well as of longer-term 
variation in ocean sea surface temperature.
2) Fitting simple functional forms to describe and explain post-fire vegetation regrowth. 
We use this approach to pull major informative patterns from a large data set of 
{MODIS} satellite measurements of “greenness” as it increases after wildfire in many 
individual patches of South African shrubland. Features of these curves can be 
interpreted biologically and can be related to weather and other environmental factors. 
Using the results, we can also project vegetation response under future modeled 
climates. 
3) Extending species distribution models. We discuss using integral projection models to 
identify environmental limitations on population growth rates of individual plant 
species. The goal of these models is to use relatively sparse demographic information 
to parameterize general environment-vital rate relationships which be combined to 
provide insight into the factors most limiting the species distribution. We also provide 
an update on an R package that implements hierarchical species distribution models 
that incorporate spatial random effects and account for land-use transformation and 
variable detection rates. 

In these examples, we use hierarchical statistical models to integrate moderately large data sets and gain insight into underlying processes, while also characterizing uncertainty associated with the results. We aim to demonstrate the utility of hierarchical statistical models for these purposes, but we also hope to encourage discussion by flagging challenges for ecologists that this workshop might address.},

	abstract = {Background/Question/Methods
The geographic distributions and environmental niche associations of species are determined by processes that vary in relevance over spatial scales. Similarly, our ability to capture species distributions - e.g. through museum records, citizen science observations, or expert knowledge – also varies with spatial scale, and so do the correlates of potential observation bias. Identifying the relative importance of key processes for mapping species or projecting distribution change thus requires an integration of both data and processes at their appropriate and relevant scales. Spatial hierarchical models in a Bayesian framework enable this integration. Through the development of such models and their application to a number of ecological examples, data types, and processes we demonstrate the promise of a new generation of distribution models that inherently address spatial scale.
Results/Conclusions
Using a variety of datasets from local to global scales and for terrestrial and freshwater species and communities we illustrate how multi-scale Hierarchical Bayesian models are able to more appropriately address ecological processes in species distribution modeling. For a North American bird species we show how the coarse-grain detections and non-detections can be downscaled to finer resolutions and used to study species-environment associations at finer grain that is limited only by the grain of the environmental data. We also introduce, and apply to South African birds, a method that enables the estimation of richness-environment association and prediction of geographic patterns of species richness at grains finer than the original grain of observation. The method is based on a hierarchical model that uses coarse-grain values of species richness and fine-grain environmental data as input. Further, we apply a similar, scale-and data-integrative set of models to North American freshwater fishes. Finally, we chart out new methodological advances in the field based on point process modeling and related approaches.},

	abstract = {Abstract
Identifying cloud interference in satellite-derived data is a critical step toward developing useful remotely sensed products. Most {MODIS} land products use a combination of the {MODIS} ({MOD}35) cloud mask and the ‘internal’ cloud mask of the surface reflectance product ({MOD}09) to mask clouds, but there has been little discussion of how these masks differ globally. We calculated global mean cloud frequency for both products, for 2009, and found that inflated proportions of observations were flagged as cloudy in the Collection 5 {MOD}35 product. These erroneously categorized areas were spatially and environmentally non-random and usually occurred over high-albedo land cover types (such as grassland and savanna) in several regions around the world. Additionally, we found that spatial variability in the processing path applied in the Collection 5 {MOD}35 algorithm affects the likelihood of a cloudy observation by up to 20\% in some areas. These factors result in abrupt transitions in recorded cloud frequency across land cover and processing-path boundaries impeding their use for fine-scale spatially contiguous modeling applications. We show that together, these artifacts have resulted in significantly decreased and spatially biased data availability for Collection 5 {MOD}35-derived composite {MODIS} land products such as land surface temperature ({MOD}11) and net primary productivity ({MOD}17). Finally, we compare our results to mean cloud frequency in the new Collection 6 {MOD}35 product, and find that land cover artifacts have been reduced but not eliminated. Collection 6 thus increases data availability for some regions and land cover types in {MOD}35-derived products but practitioners need to consider how the remaining artifacts might affect their analysis.},

A central goal of ecology is to understand the climatic factors that control ecological processes and this has become even more important in the face of climate change. Especially at global scales, there can be enormous uncertainty in underlying environmental data used to explain ecological processes, but that uncertainty is rarely quantified or incorporated into ecological models. In this study, a climate-aided Bayesian kriging approach is used to interpolate 20 years of daily meteorological observations (maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation) to a 1 arc-min grid for the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. Independent validation data revealed overall predictive performance of the interpolation to have R2 values of 0.90, 0.85, and 0.59 for maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation, respectively. A suite of ecologically relevant climate metrics that include the uncertainty introduced by the interpolation were then generated. By providing the high-resolution climate metric surfaces and uncertainties, this work facilitates richer and more robust predictive modelling in ecology and biogeography. These data can be incorporated into ecological models to propagate the uncertainties through to the final predictions.},

	abstract = {Background/Question/Methods
"Ecotourism with a Hand Lens ({EHL}) in the Miniature Forests of Cape Horn({MFCH})" at the Omora Ethnobotanical Park ({OEP}) in Puerto Williams, Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve ({CHBR}), Chile, is a conservation initiative being develop by a team of scientists, philosophers, artists, architects, engineers, musicians, and tourism operators associated with the Sub-Antarctic Biocultural Conservation Program ({SBCP}), jointly coordinated by the University of North Texas ({UNT}) in the {US}, and the Universidad de Magallanes ({UMAG}) and Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity ({IEB}) in Chile.  {EHL} builds on botanical research which determined that  {CHBR} hosts 5\% of the world's bryophyte diversity in less than 0.01\% of the Earth's land surface, distinguishing it as a biodiversity "hotspot.”  This discovery inspired a novel new type of tourism that calls attention to the high diversity of bryophytes and lichens of this region, through a field activity organized in interpretive trails where tourists get down on the ground and use magnifying glasses. At {OEP}, the trail is a one-kilometer circuit with 14 stations that calls attention to the ecological, economic, aesthetic, and ethical values these tiny forest communities, including invertebrates that inhabit them.

Results/Conclusions
A main sustainability attribute of {EHL} is that the tourists can see diverse miniature forests on the trunk of a tree or on a rock and discover the broad array of biodiversity without impacting large areas of the ecosystem. This new type of ecotourism has been implemented with great success at {OEP}, with guides specially trained in the ecological and ethical attributes of bryophyte conservation. Many tourists specifically request to visit the trail of the {MFCH}, and evaluations offered at the end of the tours indicate that tourists are highly satisfied with their experience.  The sustainability of this novel form of ecotourism is being communicated to a broad and diverse audience. Publications, including a coffee-table book entitled “Ecotourism with a Hand Lens at Omora Park,” documentaries, brochures, school texts, newspaper articles and other media have socialized this experience and an art gallery exhibition of {EHL} will be held in New York.  {EHL} could be implemented not only in the sub-Antarctic region but also in the sub-Arctic, and in the high altitudes of the Himylayas. Hence, this type of ecotourism could have applications for conservation and sustainable tourism in subpolar regions around the planet.},

The new Cape Horn Field Station, at the tip of South America in the village of Puerto Williams, supports an international network for interdisciplinary environmental research opportunities for faculty, students and affiliated research scholars. The station supports {UNT}’s work at the forefront of conservation and study in the Cape Horn archipelago. Above, Travel-Learn participants explore the archipelago.

Christopher Anderson“The goal is to have students doing research in Chile year-round so they can have a direct experience in crossing language barriers and working with students from other countries, scientists and the local society,” said Christopher Anderson, left, assistant research professor of biology and coordinator of the Sub-Antarctic Ecosystems and Biocultural Conservation research cluster and program.

“Our mission is not just to do research but to develop long-term, working relationships with local authorities and community members and to make the research socially relevant.”

The research cluster and program has worked to integrate ecological and social aspects of research, education and conservation into a long-term program. The program integrates the sciences and ethics, with an emphasis on ethno-ecology and environmental philosophy, as does a doctoral program.

The program’s facility has a library, classrooms, computer area and laboratory for processing and storing research samples and field equipment. The station also provides office and lodging space for up to 15 students and researchers during courses and expeditions in the Cape Horn region. Previously, research activities were based at a Universidad de Magallanes-owned facility in Puerto Williams that housed six people.

The new research facility sits inside the {UNESCO} Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve, a pristine ecoregion with mountains, glaciers and forests that offers a rich environment for ecological research and conservation activities.

The construction of the new field station was funded through a \$15 million grant from the {CONICYT}, the Chilean equivalent of the U.S. National Science Foundation as well as funds from {UNT}. The grant will help support research for the next 10 years.

Students, scientists, government and university officials, and visitors attended the inauguration, including officials from the Universidad de Magallanes and the Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity,  Provost and Vice President of Academic Affairs Warren Burggren, Vice President of Research and Economic Development Vish Prasad and Edgar Muñoz, Commander of the Beagle Channel Naval District. Nelson Carcarmo, Governor of the Chilean Antarctic Province presided over the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

In 2010 {UNT} and the Universidad de Magallanes co-published a guidebook of the approximate 50 species of birds in Omora Park, including scientific and local knowledge of each species. Future projects include creating a similar guidebook for lichens, mosses and liverworts and translating philosophy texts.

This dissertation quantifies the role of climate in driving ecological processes in the Cape Floristic Region ({CFR}) of South Africa, a region of extraordinary biodiversity. In the second chapter an extensive database of observed wildfires and high-resolution meteorological data were used to build a novel spatially and temporally varying survival model. This model was used to analyze fire regimes in the Cape Floristic Region ({CFR}) of South Africa during the period 1980–2000. The analysis revealed an important influence of seasonally anomalous weather on fire probability and identified that the Antarctic Ocean Oscillation ({AAO}) is also associated with fire risk. In the third chapter, a Hierarchical Bayesian model was used to assess the relationship between biomass measurements collected at fine scales (2x3 m) with the normalized difference vegetation index ({NDVI}), a satellite derived metric. The analysis revealed a strong correlation between {NDVI} and biomass and supports the use of {NDVI} in spatiotemporal analysis of vegetation dynamics in Mediterranean shrubland ecosystems. In the fourth chapter, post-fire ecosystem recovery was modeled using {NDVI} observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS}) satellite as a function of age, topography, and climate. The analysis identified the important role of climate in driving the recovery process and suggests that this critical ecosystem property will be sensitive to climate change. In the fourth chapter a climate-aided Bayesian kriging approach is used to interpolate 20 years of daily meteorological observations (maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation) to a 1 arc-minute grid for the {CFR}. Independent validation data revealed overall predictive performance of the interpolation to have R2 values of 0.90, 0.85, and 0.59 for maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation, respectively.},

We assessed accuracy using a number of metrics including Mean Absolute Error ({MAE}) and Root Mean Square Error ({RMSE}), as well as multisampling, variations in hold out proportions, and map visualization. We found that multi-time scale methods ({CAI} and {FSS}) performed better on average with lower {MAE} and {RMSE} than single-time scale methods (Kriging, {GWR} {GAM}). Results also indicate that {CAI} with Kriging produces smoother surfaces without many of the physiographic features found in the landscape when compared to {FSS} with Kriging. The research suggests that a denser meteorological station network and additional procedures of assessment may be necessary to differentiate among the {CAI} and {FSS} methods.},

and processes that occur over vast spatial and temporal scales. A central goal of ecology is
to understand the factors that control the spatial distribution of species and this has become

enormous uncertainty in environmental data used to model species distributions. Even
‘simple’ metrics such as mean annual precipitation are difficult to estimate in areas with few

stations and available data sets do not quantify uncertainty in these surfaces. We are
developing a global, 1km resolution, daily meteorological dataset for 1970-2010 by leveraging
relatively high quality station observations with spatially continuous but indirect satellite
observations. While several satellite derived precipitation products exist, all are relatively
coarse (≥0.25o). An alternative approach is to use higher resolution multi-spectral satellite data
to estimate other cloud parameters that are more directly related to precipitation. Precipitation
will fall when cloud particles achieve sufficient mass to overcome updraft winds and when the
clouds have sufficient vertical extent to facilitate the growth of these particles. The {MODIS}
Cloud Product ({MOD}06) includes estimates of effective radius and optical thickness at 1km
resolution. These parameters are theoretically related to precipitation and we are exploring
their utility in the interpolation of station precipitation observations. Improving high resolution estimates of precipitation will facilitate analysis of geographic and/or environmental shifts in
species distributions in response to global climate change.},

	title = {Climatic controls on ecosystem resilience: Post-fire regeneration in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa},
	abstract = {Background/Question/Methods

Conservation of natural resources in a changing climate requires understanding of ecosystem resilience to change. Resilience is especially important in disturbance-prone ecosystems such as the Cape Floristic Region ({CFR}) of South Africa. Recent work has shown that the fire regime in the {CFR} is sensitive to climate and suggests that climate change may lead to more frequent fires. However, the sensitivity of post-fire recovery and biomass/fuel load accumulation to climate is not well understood despite its importance in the fire regime. In this study, a Hierarchical Bayesian approach is used to model post-fire ecosystem recovery using {MODIS}-derived {NDVI} observations as a function of stand age, topography, and climate. The model has three levels, 1) an exponential function fit to the observed {NDVI} data, 2) multivariate regressions that associate the terms of the exponential function to a suite of topographical, soil, and climate variables, and 3) a set of vague priors. Two models were fit, with and without climate data, and compared using the Deviance Information Criterion ({DIC}).

Results/Conclusions

The full model had a lower {DIC} than the topography-only model (Δ{DIC}=31,356) indicating strong support for the hypothesis that climate has an important influence on post-fire recovery. The coefficient of determination (R2) was used to assess the predictive performance of the model using a hold-out validation data set. The predicted vs. observed R2 values ranged from 0.34 to 0.51 depending on the time-since-fire of the validation data. The rate of recovery was positively associated with soil fertility, minimum July (winter) temperature, and maximum January (summer) precipitation. Precipitation seasonality, maximum January temperature, solar radiation, and elevation all were negatively correlated with the recovery rate. Estimated recovery times ranged from {\textless} 5 years to {\textgreater}25 years, depending on the environmental conditions. The important role of climate in driving the recovery process suggests that this critical ecosystem property will be sensitive to climate change.},

Seasonal variability was removed from all variables using nonparametric smoothed function ({LOESS}) of day of study. Generalized additive models were used to estimate the effect of elevated levels of pollutants on {ER} visits. Relative risks of pollutants are reported over their interquartile range ({IQR}, the 75th –25th percentile pollutant values). In Portland, an {IQR} increase in {SO}2 was associated with a 5\% (95\% {CI} 2–7\%) increase in all respiratory {ER} visits and a 6\% (95\% {CI} 1–12\%) increase in asthma visits. An {IQR} increase in O3 was associated with a 5\% (95\% {CI} 1–10\%) increase in Portland asthmatic {ER} visits. No significant associations were found in Manchester, New Hampshire, possibly due to statistical limitations of analyzing a smaller population. The absence of statistical evidence for a relationship should not be used as evidence of no relationship. This analysis reveals that, on a daily basis, elevated {SO}2 and O3 have a significant impact on public health in Portland, Maine.},

Both the richness and abundance models indicate that climate variables were most influential in determining the incidence or cover of invasives, followed by site and {LULC} variables.  Invasive species richness was higher in warmer areas with lower annual and highly seasonally variable precipitation.  Edge habitats increased and evergreen forest and cropland {LULC} decreased invasive richness.  The abundance analysis showed differences in the direction and magnitude of the effect of each predictive variable among the five species, demonstrating the need for both synthetic and species‐specific approaches to prediction and management.  Model predictions suggest that all species, except E.umbellata, may be more abundant relative to current climate under moderate predictions ({CCSM}3), but that their incidence may be reduced under extreme climate predictions ({HadCM}3).},

	title = {Facilitation of global change research in the tropics: science and data management},
	abstract = {To  date,  much  global  change  research  has  focused  on  temperate  and  polar  systems (Parmesan, 2006). However, it is becoming increasingly clear that even small changes in temperature and precipitation can have large consequences for organisms in the tropics (e.g. Clark, 2007). Since the mid-1970s, tropical regions have experienced a mean temperature
increase  of  0.26°C±0.05°C  per  decade  (Malhi  \& Wright,  2004).  Global climate  models predict overall increases in tropical temperatures of 1–4°C in the 21st  century and regional changes in precipitation with local increases of up to 8\% and local decreases of up to 35\% ({IPCC}, 2007). While it is widely acknowledged that these shifts in climatic conditions will likely  have  significant  effects  on  the  flora  and  fauna  of  the  tropics,  there  is  currently insufficient data to predict and mitigate these impacts. In addition to climate change, tropical ecosystems  also  face  a  host  of  threats  including  deforestation,  pollutants,  habitat  loss, overexploitation,  degradation  and  fragmentation  (Wright,  2005).  Given  that  tropical ecosystems provide a wealth of ecosystem services and harbor a large proportion of the earth’s biodiversity, urgent action is needed to increase understanding of how these valuable and complex systems will respond to ongoing and predicted threats. Studies of global change in the tropics have been hindered by several challenges unique to tropical systems. First, the high species richness of most biological communities in the tropics makes it difficult to carry out inventories and to characterize interactions. As a result, we lack basic data for most tropical species, including species’ resource requirements,
environmental tolerances and distribution patterns. Thus, it is not surprising that we lack sufficient information to make informed predictions of how tropical species and communities will respond to changes in climatic conditions or the degree to which they can recover from other types of human  disturbance. Second, most countries in the tropics are developing
nations and lack the infrastructure and funding for large scale global change research. As a result, there is currently a paucity of long term climate and biological records for most tropical sites, making it difficult to ascertain whether communities are changing and whether such changes are due to changing environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {There is overwhelming evidence that anthropogenic air pollution is detrimental to 
human health.  New England is currently experiencing an asthma epidemic and has many
counties that do not meet the current {EPA} air quality standards.  However, virtually no 
studies on air quality and health have been completed  in New England, despite its 
population of 14 million people and unique air chemistry and weather phenomena.  Until 
now, it has simply been inferred that associations between air chemistry and human 
health found in other places must be similar in northern New England.  The need for a
better understanding of this relationship was  established at the Conference of the New 
England Governors and the Eastern Canadian Premiers, where air quality and health
research was identified as a priority in the region ({NEG}/{ECP}, 2002). 
Hospital emergency room ({ER}) records from the period 1996-2000 from Portland, 
Maine and Manchester, New Hampshire are reviewed and compared to daily records of 
air quality and weather.  Time-series analysis utilizing generalized additive models
revealed significant increases in {ER} visits due to sulfur dioxide and ozone in the Portland.  
In Portland, an interquartile range ({IQR}) increase in {SO}2 was associated with a 5\% (95\% {CI} 2-7\%) increase in all respiratory {ER} visits and a 6\% (95\% {CI} 1-12\%) increase in 
asthma visits.  An {IQR} increase in O3 was associated with a 5\% (95\% {CI} 1-10\%) increase 
in Portland asthmatic {ER} visits.  Positive, but not statistically significant, associations
were found in Manchester.  The lack of significance is probably due to the smaller size of 
the city.  The results indicate that elevated concentrations of {SO}2 and O3, even at levels 
below current air quality standards, significantly impact public health in northern New 
England. 
The associations reported in this study are of special interest for the region, as 
much of its pollution, both {SO}2 and O3, is transported from sources in other states
(Cleveland et al., 1976; {LeClair}, 1997).  The presence of a detrimental effect of air 
pollution on human health suggests that pollution sources outside the region may be 
partly responsible for health impacts within northern New England.},

	abstract = {Understanding the drivers of phenological events is vital for forecasting species responses to climate change. We have developed flexible Bayesian survival regression models to assess a 29-year, individual-level time series of flowering phenology from four species of Japanese cherry trees (Prunus spachiana, Prunus x yedoensis, Prunus jamasakura, and Prunus lannesiana), from the Tama Forest Cherry Preservation Garden in Hachioji, Japan. Our modeling framework used time-varying (chill and heat units) and time-invariant (slope, aspect, and elevation) factors and demonstrated some important features for modeling phenology of temperate plants. Our results show that both chill and heat contribute to flowering times and that microsite factors likely modulate the temperatures experienced by each tree. Sequential effects of chilling and heating, as opposed to parallel chilling and heating, were best supported by the data and correspond well to our physiological understanding of plant flowering physiology and phenology. We found limited species differences in sensitivity to chill, but that earlier flowering taxa, such as P. spachiana, were more sensitive to heat than later flowering taxa, such as P. lannesiana. Under climate change projections from an ensemble of three Regional Climate Models, we expect flowering to shift 30-31 days earlier on average for all four taxa by 2100 under the A1B emissions scenario. Dramatic shifts in the flowering times of cherry trees may have implications for economically important cultural festivals in Japan and East Asia.},

There have also been three major multi-city studies, which together analyzed data from well over 100 cities in Europe and North America. Various air pollutants, especially ozone (O-3), particulate matter ({PM}), nitrogen dioxide ({NO}2) and sulfur dioxide ({SOA} were generally found to be significantly associated with increased use of hospital services.

	abstract = {Fire is a defining component of the fynbos ecosystem in the Cape Floristic Region ({CFR}) of South Africa. Many ecologically important species require fire for reproduction and the frequency of fire is a primary determinant of species composition. It has been hypothesized that climate change will increase fire frequency by raising temperature and reducing the reliability of rainfall. However, little work has been done to quantify the relationship between fire occurrence and climate factors. In this study, we present spatio-temporal statistical models to explain the monthly variability of fire frequency in mountain fynbos regions from 1980-2000. Meteorological data are from the Climate Systems Analysis group in Cape Town and the fire data were provided by {CapeNature}. We found a clear relationship between temperature, precipitation, and fire events, with more and larger fires occurring in hotter, drier months and years. Other important factors include total precipitation over the previous 12 months and the El Nino Southern Oscillation. These findings have important ramifications for conservation and management of fynbos. If climate change leads to higher temperatures or lower rainfall, our models imply that fire frequency will increase. Increased fire frequency will favor re-sprouters and other species that reproduce quickly over plants with slower reproduction cycles. Thus, if the fire regime changes, the community composition of the fynbos could change.},

enormous uncertainty in environmental data used to model species distributions. Even

coarse (≥0.25o). An alternative approach is to use higher resolution multi-spectral satellite data
to estimate other cloud parameters that are more directly related to precipitation. Precipitation
will fall when cloud particles achieve sufficient mass to overcome updraft winds and when the
clouds have sufficient vertical extent to facilitate the growth of these particles. The {MODIS}
Cloud Product ({MOD}06) includes estimates of effective radius and optical thickness at 1km

their utility in the interpolation of station precipitation observations. Improving high resolution estimates of precipitation will facilitate analysis of geographic and/or environmental shifts in

We demonstrate the importance of complementing these popular models with spatially explicit, dynamic mechanistic models that link potential and realized distributions. We develop general grid-based, pattern-oriented spread models incorporating three mechanisms—plant population growth, local dispersal, and long-distance dispersal—to predict broadscale spread patterns in heterogeneous landscapes. We use the model to examine the spread of the invasive Celastrus orbiculatus (Oriental bittersweet) by Sturnus vulgaris (European starling) across northeastern North America. We find excellent quantitative agreement with historical spread records over the last century that are critically linked to the geometry of heterogeneous landscapes and each of the explanatory mechanisms considered. Spread of bittersweet before 1960 was primarily driven by high growth rates in developed and agricultural landscapes, while subsequent spread was mediated by expansion into deciduous and coniferous forests. Large, continuous patches of coniferous forests may substantially impede invasion. The success of C. orbiculatus and its potential mutualism with S. vulgaris suggest troubling predictions for the spread of other invasive, fleshy-fruited plant species across northeastern North America.},

	title = {Hierarchical statistical models for ecological data: Combining explanation and prediction},
	abstract = {Background/Question/Methods

Ecologists increasingly use hierarchical statistical modeling to incorporate ecological processes into phenomenological statistical models. These models range from primarily phenomenological ones that use conditional probability to pull apart distinct processes affecting observed patterns (e.g. modeling presence or absence, then detection given presence), to dynamic approaches that fit process models to data (e.g. assimilating time series data into dynamic population models). Ideally, these models can embody best of the “two cultures” of explanation and prediction. On the other hand, some have criticized them as overly complex, cumbersome and data hungry. In an era of big data sets, are hierarchical statistical models an important tool – can they predict better than traditional statistical methods (e.g. logistic regression, etc.) while remaining more explanatory than algorithmic methods (e.g. {MAXENT}, etc.)? Should the answer depend entirely on how well the models predict phenomena outside of the range of the input data? As a basis for answering these questions I present results from two case studies using hierarchical Bayesian models to analyze two kinds of “big data” – 1) large-scale plant species distributions including abundance and presence-only data; and 2) population-level responses to environmental conditions using time series data sets from weather stations and soil moisture probes.

Results/Conclusions

If predictive power is the basis for model evaluation, then for some problems algorithmic approaches are clearly attractive. Usually their key advantage is their ability to rapidly search through high-dimensional model space, as in the case of predicting species distribution patterns. Nonetheless, we show that hierarchical statistical models can in some cases predict species distributions comparably well. More importantly, most very large data sets in the “data rich era” are spatiotemporal data sets in which analysis seems to require some form of explanatory model. For example, we present hierarchical statistical models to relate weather data to ecosystem properties such as soil moisture and then to population responses. This requires some form of system understanding, plus some basis for deciding what summaries of the data to include as candidate explanatory variables. We show that hierarchical statistical models can usefully integrate such spatiotemporal data sets by using them to predict soil moisture patterns and plant population responses in California oak savannah and South African shrubland.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated strong correlations between warming temperatures and increased fire frequencies. Changes in fire regime would strongly affect the future of the mediterranean-climate shrublands of the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, since the persistence of the biome and its extraordinarily high plant biodiversity depend on regular fire recurrence. Acceleration of fire return times here would alter relative abundances of species, shift biome boundaries, and alter water cycling. We use an extensive 26-year record of fires on public lands in these shrublands ({\textgreater}1500 fires over {\textbackslash} 40,000 km2), together with high-resolution records of daily temperature and precipitation, to explore temporal and spatial trends in climate and fire regime. Using Bayesian spatio-temporal event models, we link these data sets to associate patterns in fire frequency and seasonality with drought dynamics, vegetation productivity, and global-scale climate cycles (e.g. {SOI}). Preliminary results show that the region has experienced significant acceleration in fire frequency from 1980-2005, and that this acceleration is associated with changes in mean and extreme climate characteristics (e.g. soil moisture availability, maximum drought stress). Further, we find that these regional changes exhibit meaningful patterns at the subregional scale (east-west gradient in magnitude of changes) and the global scale (linkage to global sea-surface temperature cycles). In our ongoing work we are exploring connections between fire and modeled soil moisture, vegetation productivity, water use efficiency and developing dynamic coupled models of these relationships, which we plan to validate using both field and satellite-derived productivity observations.},

However, there is potential to use subpixel classification techniques to quantify even finer categories, such as the percent cover of specific families, genera, or functional groups of plants. Two maximum entropy ({MaxEnt}) models were constructed as a feasibility test for fynbos community composition classification.

This study investigated how the redistribution of stations within a climate division has affected purported annual trends in precipitation. {CDD} were compared to {USHCN} data for the 15 climate divisions of New England. Results showed that trends in the datasets are not always the same. We conclude that changing mean latitude, longitude, and elevation of stations within a division through time can affect, and even induce, trends in the time series. Trends found here were mostly increasing through time, but rates of change differed dramatically in some cases. Two climate divisions did have opposing trends between datasets. It appears that other factors, such as distance from the coast and changing slope direction ( aspect) of stations, may also influence these trends. Citation: Keim, B. D., M. R. Fischer, and A. M.

	abstract = {1. Reliable methods to downscale species distributions from coarse to fine grain (equivalent to resolution or
support) hold great potential benefit for ecology and conservation. Existing methods have been based on
partially unrealistic assumptions and yield mixed results.
2. Here, we introduce a novel and simple approach for downscaling species distribution models based on a
hierarchical Bayesian modelling ({HBM}) framework. Our approach treats putative (unknown) fine-grain
presences/absences as latent variables, which are modelled as a function of observed fine-grain environmental
variables and constrained by observed coarse-grain presences/absences using logistic regression. The aim is to
produce downscaled fine-grain probabilities of species occurrence that (1) closely resemble the probabilities
produced by a logistic model parameterized with the observed fine-grain data (the ‘reference model’) and (2) are
improvements over conventional downscaling methods. We additionally test how fine-grain occupancy based on
power-law scale-area relationships modifies the downscaling results. We test our approach on 127 bird species
from the San Diego breeding atlas data surveyed at 5 km grain.
3. The {HBM} approach provides unbiased fine-grain probabilities of occurrence whilst the conventional methods
(direct approach, point sampling) consistently over-predict occurrence probabilities. Incorporation of the down-
scaled occupancy further improves reliability of the models, but only in cases when the fine-grain occupancy is
estimated accurately.
4. Summing predictions across grid cells and species, {HBMs} provide better estimates of fine-grain species
richness than conventional methods. They also provide better estimates of fine-grain occupancy (prevalence).
5. The presented {HBM}-based downscaling approach offers improved predictions of fine-grain presence and
absence compared with existing methods. The combination of the Bayesian approach with key macroecological
relationships (specifically, the scale-area relationship) offers a promising general basis for downscaling distribu-
tions that may be extended, for example, using generalized linear or additive models. These approaches enable
integrative predictions of spatial biodiversity patterns at fine grains.},

Here we investigate the factors that infuence co-occurrence of members of the genus Protea in the Cape Floristic Region of southwestern Africa, a global hotspot of biodiversity. Due to the binomial nature of our response, a critical issue is to choose appropriate link functions for the regression model. In this paper we propose a new family of fexible link functions for modeling binomial response data. By introducing a power parameter into the cdf corresponding to a symmetric link function and its mirror refection, greater fexibility in skewness can be achieved in both positive and negative directions. Through simulated data sets and analysis of the Protea co-occurrence data, we show that the proposed link function is quite fexible and performs better against link misspeci⬚cation than existing standard link functions.},

However, reliable forecasts of the spread of newly introduced species are rare. The idiosyncratic nature of the invasion process, where both historical and local conditions affect the likelihood of establishment, makes generalization of the invasion process very difficult and hampers our ability to generate guidelines for the early control of potentially invasive species and their newly arrived populations. To develop reliable models of future plant invasions in New England we studied the past patterns of plant spread into the region. Information on invasive plant species presence, abundance, and site properties were gathered for more than 4200 locations in New England by volunteers working in conjunction with the Invasive Plant Atlas of New England ({IPANE}).

This approach was appropriate in that it provides for the specification of uncertainty in model components and accepts prior knowledge and data from multiple sources.

	abstract = {The fact that plant invasions are an ongoing process makes generalizations of invasive spread extraordinarily challenging. This is particularly true given the idiosyncratic nature of invasions, in which both historical and local conditions affect establishment success and hinder our ability to generate guidelines for early detection and eradication of invasive species. To overcome these limitations we have implemented a comprehensive approach that examines plant invasions at three spatial scales: regional, landscape, and local levels. At each scale, in combination with the others, we have evaluated the role of key environmental variables such as climate, landscape structure, habitat type, and canopy closure in the spread of three commonly found invasive woody plant species in New England, Berberis thunbergii, Celastrus orbiculatus, and Euonymus alatus. We developed a spatially explicit hierarchical Bayesian model that allowed us to take into account the ongoing nature of the spread of invasive species and to incorporate presence/absence data from the species' native ranges as well as from the invaded regions. Comparisons between predictions from climate-only models with those from the multiscale forecasts emphasize the importance of including landscape structure in our models of invasive species' potential distributions. In addition, predictions generated using only native range data performed substantially worse than those that incorporated data from the target range. This points out important limitations in extrapolating distributional ranges from one region to another.},

	abstract = {Explaining the distribution of a species using local environmental features is a long stand- ing ecological problem. Often, available data is collected as a set of presence locations only thus precluding the possibility of a desired presence-absence analysis.We propose that it is natural to view presence-only data as a point pattern over a region and to use local environmental features to explain the intensity driving this point pattern. We use a hierarchical model to treat the presence data as a realization of a spatial point process, whose intensity is governed by the set of environmental covari- ates. Spatial dependence in the intensity levels is modeled with random effects involving a zero mean Gaussian process. We augment the model to capture highly variable and typically sparse sampling effort as well as land transformation, both of which degrade the point pattern. The Cape Floristic Region ({CFR}) in South Africa provides an extensive class of such species data. The potential (i.e., nondegraded) presence surfaces over the entire area are of interest from a conservation and policy perspective. The region is divided into ∼ 37, 000 grid cells. To work with a Gaussian process over a very large number of cells we use predictive spatial process ap- proximation. Bias correction by adding a heteroscedastic error component has also been implemented. We illustrate with modeling for six of different species. Also, comparison is made with the now popu- lar Maxent approach though the latter is limited with regard to inference. The resultant patterns are important on their own but also enable a comparative view, for example, to investigate whether a pair of species are potentially competing in the same area. An additional feature of our modeling is the opportunity to infer about biodiversity through species richness, i.e., the number of distinct species in an areal unit. such investigation immediately follows within our modeling framework.},

Background/Question/Methods
Plant and animal species phenology, the timing of natural events, have been one of the mechanisms most affected by current climate change. Within this realm, trends taking place in the last few decades of global warming are being used to make forecasts into the future. However, they are limited in their scope as they are only available for a few species in one or a few locations.  
Here we present an analysis of the phenological response (spring, summer and fall) to climate variation of several plant and animal species, whose phenological events were monitored at 176 meteorological stations in Japan and South Korea from 1953 to 2005. For that we developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to examine the complex interactions of temperature, site effects, and latitude on phenology. 
Results/Conclusions

Results show species-specific variation in the magnitude and the direction of their responses to increasing temperature, which also differ from site to site. At most sites the differences in phenology among species are forecast to become greater with warmer temperatures. Primary producers’ phenology is highly linked to changes in temperature, while animal species show a wider range of responses to increasing temperature. Our results clearly demonstrate that it is difficult to generalize from one site to another because of differences that exist between the phenological responses of individual species and sites.  Large datasets that span broad geographic areas will aid scientists to improve predictions of how phenological responses and ecological relationships will change in the future.},

on these downscaled data from multiple models, five extreme indices were analyzed for the future climate

and bias corrected model outputs for the present-day climate were compared with observations, which dem-
onstrated that bias correction is important not only for {GCM} outputs, but also for {RCM} outputs. For future cli-
mate, bias correction led to a higher level of agreements among the models in predicting the magnitude and
capturing the spatial pattern of the extreme climate indices. We found that the incorporation of dynamical
downscaling as an intermediate step does not lead to considerable differences in the results of statistical downscaling for the study domain.},
