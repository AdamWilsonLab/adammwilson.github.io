  <h1>Climate Modeling</h1>
  <h2>Wilson, Adam M. and Lynch, Cary</h2>
  <p>This module will expose students to the science of climate change and global change biology, focusing on accessing and evaluating climate summary and weather station data from various sources. We will examine 1) the basics of the climate system 2) how and why our climate is changing, and 3) how to use that knowledge to understand and predict ecological processes. This would build on Module 1 and feed into Module 3. (This module is being co-developed with assistance from Prof. Anji Seth in Geography.)</p>
