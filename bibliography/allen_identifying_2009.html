  <p>Invasive species are a global ecological and economic issue, making inference on where to target early control and
eradication efforts critical.  We aimed to forecast hotspots of invasion in terms of invasive species richness and high
abundance of particular species by combining climate, land‐use/land‐cover (LULC), and habitat information in spatially‐explicit hierarchical Bayesian models.  Species occurrence and abundance data were derived from the Invasive Plant Atlas of New England (IPANE), demonstrating the potential for fruitful collaborations between researchers, citizen scientists, and resource managers.  Species–specific analyses included prominent plant invaders in New England: Berberis thunbergii (Japanese barberry), Celastrus orbiculatus (Oriental bittersweet), Elaeagnus umbellata (autumn olive), Euonymus alata (burning bush), and Rosa multiflora (multiflora rose).  Projections were made using two future climate models (CCSM3 and UKMO‐HadCM3) in addition to current climate. Both the richness and abundance models indicate that climate variables were most influential in determining the incidence or cover of invasives, followed by site and LULC variables.  Invasive species richness was higher in warmer areas with lower annual and highly seasonally variable precipitation.  Edge habitats increased and evergreen forest and cropland LULC decreased invasive richness.  The abundance analysis showed differences in the direction and magnitude of the effect of each predictive variable among the five species, demonstrating the need for both synthetic and species‐specific approaches to prediction and management.  Model predictions suggest that all species, except E.umbellata, may be more abundant relative to current climate under moderate predictions (CCSM3), but that their incidence may be reduced under extreme climate predictions (HadCM3).</p>
