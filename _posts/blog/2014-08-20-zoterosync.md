I use the wonderful Zotero reference manager but have been frustrated by it's small storage for attachments (which I want to sync to read on multiple devices). 

1. [Zotero Storage](https://www.zotero.org/support/storage) is quite expensive ($60/year for 6GB).  Given that I'm already paying $120/year to Google Drive for 1TB, I'd rather use that storage directly.
2. They only support WebDaav backups which seem to be getting rarer and rarer.  Neither Dropbox or Google Drive currently support the WebDaav protocols.

However [box.com](box.com) provides a full 10GB for free _and_ provides webDaav access.  **Awesome**.
