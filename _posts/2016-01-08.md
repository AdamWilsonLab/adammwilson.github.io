# Model‐based integration of observed and expert‐based information for assessing the geographic and environmental distribution of freshwater species
Sami Domisch, Adam M Wilson, Walter Jetz

## Abstract
Freshwater ecosystems harbor specialized and vulnerable biodiversity, and the
prediction of potential impacts of freshwater biodiversity to environmental change requires
knowledge of the geographic and environmental distribution of taxa. To date, however, such
quantitative information about freshwater species distributions remains limited. Major
impediments include heterogeneity in available species occurrence data, varying
detectability of species in their aquatic environment, scarcity of contiguous freshwater- ...
