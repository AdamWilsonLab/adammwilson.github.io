 I worked with [Clean Air -- Cool Planet](http://cleanair-coolplanet.org) to develop an Excel toolkit (v1.0) to facilitate greenhouse gas emissions inventories at colleges and universities. The tool has been used by at least 600 different universities and serves as a first step towards emission reductions.  See [Clean Air -- Cool Planet's website](http://cleanair-coolplanet.org/campus-carbon-calculator/) for up-to-date information on this project.
