# Background
From March 2004 to May 2006 I served as a Community Forestry Agent with the Moroccan Ministry of Water and Forests and the U.S. Peace Corps with my wife in a small village in the Argan Biosphere Reserve in southwest Morocco. During my time there I worked on a project to document and identify the plants present in the Amsittene Mountian Protected Area. Below are several products from this work and related materials.
