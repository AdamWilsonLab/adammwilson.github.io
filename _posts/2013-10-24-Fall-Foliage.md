Tourism and related activities during the fall foliage season contribute $8 billion annually to the New England economy, but we know very little about how climate change will affect this important socio-ecological phenomenon.

Existing studies of the potential impact of climate on fall foliage have been limited to species distribution models that predict a decline of two colorful species, red maple (_Acer rubrum_) and sugar maple (_Acer saccharum_). However, species distribution models estimate the potential geographic niche and are not very informative about the magnitude or timing of changes in foliage in a changing climate. Several recent reports in the gray literature have suggested that the vibrancy of the fall display will be sensitive to climate change, but beyond scattered anecdotes such as “Bright days and cold nights help create autumn splendor”, we don’t understand the environmental factors that influence the year-to-year variability of the coloration and cannot make quantitative predictions despite their ecological and socio-economic importance. Furthermore, by quantifying leaf coloration using satellite imagery, this research will create opportunities for investigating intraspecific ‘trait’ variation due to phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation over continental spatial scales.

This is important for understanding the evolutionary history of the trait and could become a key study system for understanding intraspecific associations between climate change and biological variation. I propose to improve our understanding of the potential impact of climate change on the intensity, duration, and timing of the fall foliage color display in the Northeastern U.S. by quantitatively answering the following questions:

* How has the timing and intensity of the fall foliage display varied across the Northeastern United States over the last ten years?
* What meteorological factors, such as temperature and precipitation, are associated with the timing and intensity of the fall foliage display?
* Can meteorological data be used to predict the timing and intensity of the fall display in advance?
* How will climate change affect the vibrancy and spatio-temporal dynamics of the fall foliage?
