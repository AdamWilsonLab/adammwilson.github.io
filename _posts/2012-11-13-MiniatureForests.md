#	Exploring the Miniature Forests of Cape Horn
 
##	Introduction
Photographs can transcend culture and facilitate an understanding of and appreciation for the natural world. In combination with an appropriate scientific context, images of the incredible biological and cultural diversity and landscapes of the Patagonia (including the often ignored micro-environments of non-vascular flora) will serve to inspire and motivate Chileans and non-Chileans alike. In this role it is important that photographs not only capture the attention of the viewer, but assist in story-telling. The experience and ability to understand the science behind the story is an important asset in a photographer and guides my work to capture images that lead others through (often complicated) ecological stories. I was fortunate to work as a Photographer for a National Science Foundation funded project (Integrating ecological sciences and environmental philosophy for biocultural conservation in the temperate and subantarctic Ecoregions of southern South America) in the Chilean Patagonia. We produced two books on the Miniature Forests of Cape Horn: Ecotourism with a Hand Lens (University of North Texas Press, Denton, TX, USA). The project also led to photographic contributions to outreach and educational materials for the Omora Ethnobotanical Park, La Prensa Austral (a Chilean newspaper, 2/21/2011), the Giornale DiVicenza (an Italian newspaper, January 9, 13, 14, 15, 2011), and the Mercurio (a Chilean newspaper, 11/13/2012).
