Prior to his doctoral work, Wilson served as a community forestry agent in the Moroccan Arganeraie Biosphere Reserve with the U.S. Peace Corps. Before that he earned a M.Sc. in Earth Science (concentrating in climate change) and B.Sc. in Biology (concentrating in ecology) at the University of New Hampshire. Concurrently, he examined historical climate records at the Climate Change Research Center and served as the project coordinator for the Integrated Human Health and Air Quality Research Project.
