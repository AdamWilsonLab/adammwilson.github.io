No one cause or entity can be pinned as the culprit for our environmental woes. Instead, the modern environmental problems are chronic, widespread, complex, variable, very much intertwined and often not-so-visible. Each and every individual, community, and institution are stakeholders in the quest for a sustainable future. These chronic, widespread challenges call for chronic widespread solutions, most of which can be approached using one of four methods:

1. Reconnecting people to the nature on which they depend
2. Educating decision makers (consumers, voters, policy makers) about pertinent scientific knowledge
3. Mediating difficult conversations between parties with conflicting philosophies or conflicting desired uses for a particular place or resource
4. Facilitating the presently voiceless to simply tell their story


The process of using photography to connect people to nature, enhance the conversation between science and society, buffer difficult conversations and empower the voiceless can be described as conservation photography. It is essential that conservation photography education be available to those individuals seeking to use photography for these purposes. Providing this opportunity through informal education is crucial. Although a likely place for training conservation photographers would be colleges and universities, in general the insular nature of higher education inhibits the synthesis between the visual arts, science, and community outreach. Only a handful of conservation photography courses and seminars have been offered. Students of conservation photography have been self-motivated, self-taught, have sought out multiple degrees in distinct fields, and have found mentorship beyond the ivory tower. In addition, many scientists are interested in communication. This is apparent by the increasing number of communication forums during scientific conferences, and is also evident by the increasing number of scientist-photographers applying to the North American Nature Photographer’s Association College Photography Scholarship Program (NANPA CPSP).


Science offers many insights into the ways we depend on our environment and how to develop sustainable attitudes, behaviors and policies. But these insights are rarely communicated well and often not grasped by society at large. There is a dire need to cultivate effective communications between science and society. Dry scientific statements about numbers of species, rates of deforestation, or the functions of wetlands are often too cerebral and seldom compelling to non-scientists. Additionally, in the absence of two-way communication and an engaged public, scientific knowledge can be applied in unsustainable ways that displace more sustainable low-tech, indigenous methods that are also deeply tied to local culture. To communicate effectively about conservation issues, one must both “arouse and fulfill” the audience (Olson, 2009). Science is great at fulfillment but is often horrible at arousal. Photography, on the other hand, can be a powerful medium to capture attention but often leaves the viewer hungry for more details. When used together, photography and conservation science can engage the public and share detailed information and stories.
